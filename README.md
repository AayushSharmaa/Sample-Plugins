# Code Block Plugin

This plugin converts selected text or pasted text into a code block with automatic programming language detection. The languages that
is detectable can be selected in the plugin settings. The language detection is provided by highlight.js and is in no means
perfect, but it works most of the time. If it guesses wrong, remove that language from the list and try again.
