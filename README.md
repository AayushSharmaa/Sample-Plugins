# Obsidian Bulk Rename Plugin

## Introduction

This plugin was developed to cover my initial needs and rename a bunch of files and update their reference in code base respectively. So now you can rename a bunch of files from the directory and all imports also will be updated in a code-base

## How to use?

- **folder location** - Files from which folder you need to rename
- **Symbols in existing files** - the symbols/characters that we have in the files
- **Replacement Symbols** - a new symbols that will be pasted instead
- **Files within the folder** - this is for information purpose

## Installing

The plugin in beta. To beta test, you can install the plugin using BRAT (see [BRAT > Adding a beta plugin](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat#adding-a-beta-plugin) for further instructions).
