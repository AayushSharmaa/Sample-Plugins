# Obsidian Bulk Rename Plugin

**Note:** The Obsidian API is still in early alpha and is subject to change at any time!

# Introduction

This plugin was developed to cover my initial needs and rename a bunch of files
and update their reference in code base respectively.
So now you can rename a bunch of files from the directory
and all imports also will be updated in a code-base


# How to use?

- **folder location** - Files from which folder you need to rename
- **Symbols in existing files** - the symbols/characters that we have in the files in that particular directory
- **Replacement Symbols** - a new symbols that will be pasted instead
- **Files within the folder** - this is for information purpose
